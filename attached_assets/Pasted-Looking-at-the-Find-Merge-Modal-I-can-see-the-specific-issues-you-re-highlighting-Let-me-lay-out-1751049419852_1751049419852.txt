Looking at the Find & Merge Modal, I can see the specific issues you're highlighting. Let me lay out a plan to clean up the Similar Tags section and ask clarifying questions.
Current Issues in Similar Tags Section

Problem 1: UUID Dominance

    Raw UUIDs like a7b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890 taking up visual space
    Should follow the pattern: Clean name primary, small UUID secondary (only when needed)

Problem 2: Unnecessary Location Info

    References showing full file paths that don't add value for similarity matching
    Should focus on the similarity match reason, not file location

Problem 3: Match Confidence Misleading

    "50% match" and other partial matches could be deceptive
    Only 100% matches should be highlighted/emphasized

Improvement Plan for Similar Tags Section
Phase 1: Clean Up Tag Display

    Primary Display: Tag name (e.g., "BioNex Systems", "CloudVest")
    Secondary Info: Entity type and reference count (e.g., "organization • 2 reference(s)")
    UUID Handling: Hide completely unless needed for technical disambiguation
    Match Reason: Clear explanation (e.g., "Name contains 'tech'", "Shared alias: technology")

Phase 2: Highlight 100% Matches Only

    100% Match: Special visual treatment (border, background, icon)
    Partial Matches: Standard display with clear match reason
    Remove Percentages: Replace with descriptive match reasons

Phase 3: Simplify Reference Information

    Remove File Paths: Don't show board_members_5cd7...card.txt
    Focus on Content: Show match context instead of location
    Clean References: Just show reference count, not file details

Questions Before Implementation:

    100% Match Definition: What constitutes a 100% match in your view?
        Exact name match only?
        Name + entity type match?
        Include alias exact matches?

    Match Reason Display: For partial matches, should we show:
        "Shared alias: technology"
        "Name similarity: contains 'corp'"
        "Entity type match: organization"

    UUID Visibility: Should UUIDs be:
        Completely hidden in Similar Tags section?
        Available on hover/click for technical users?
        Only shown when there are name conflicts?

    Visual Hierarchy: For 100% matches, what visual treatment?
        Colored border (gold/green)?
        Different background?
        Special icon/badge?

Once you clarify these points, I'll implement the changes to make the Similar Tags section clean, user-friendly, and properly emphasize perfect matches while de-emphasizing technical details.

100% Match Definition: For now just go with 100 percent or more, we will play with the formula later. Match Reason Display: "Shared alias: technology", we should always say exactly what matched. John is a stronger match than John Smith. Hide the UUID's in the search, humans can't match those quickly. We will get more advanced later. Visual Hierarchy: Gold just like it is is fine. I just want to change the critera from %50 to 100% Go ahead with phase 1
